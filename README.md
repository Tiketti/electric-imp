## WaterBoiling
Send a push notification to device when water is boiling.

## MFP-lights
Calory consumption data is pulled from MyFitnessPal's site using a Heroku hosted Ruby script. That script also sends a message to DweetIO which isImp listens to. Imp's lights are lit up as calories consumed approaches daily calorie goal.

Original Ruby script borrowed from [Krzysztof Zab≈Çocki]("https://gist.github.com/krzysztofzablocki/f5f597f04b2efcb711c7").
